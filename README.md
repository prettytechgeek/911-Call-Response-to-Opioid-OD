# 911-Call-Response-to-Opioid-OD
 Initially I assumed there would be a spike around holidays and when major political events occurred. However, looking at the data the call volume was relatively lower during holiday seasons and the weeks with a larger number of calls did not correlate to any political events. I did take note that the lowest call volume was the week of August 28, 2022, and the highest call volume was the week of May 28, 2023. Again, no major events occurred. I noticed that the number of calls more than tripled in the week of September 24, 2023, compared to the week of August 28, 2022. That leads me to believe that over the past year opioid use has become more rampant and more people are overdosing. There is not a trending increase in overdose-related calls, but we can clearly see that there is a steady increase from last year to this one. Spreading awareness and making opioids less accessible would be a great start to a decrease in use and ergo a decrease in overdoses.
